                    Habitat
                </h2>
                Peregrine falcons are among the world's most common birds of prey and live on all continents except
                Antarctica.
                They prefer wide-open spaces, and thrive near coasts where shorebirds are common, but they can
                be found everywhere from tundra to deserts.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>
                    Behaviour
                </h2>
                Peregrine falcons are solitary, territorial, top predators. Those that migrate live alone more than 8
                months of the year, spending only 16-18 weeks with a mate raising a family. Non-migratory peregrines,
                such as those in Pittsburgh, stay on territory alone or as a mated pair.

                <h2>
                    Diet
                </h2>
                Their typical prey items include shorebirds, ducks, grebes, gulls, pigeons, and songbirds. Peregrine
                falcons also eat bats, and they occasionally steal prey—including fish and rodents—from other raptors.

                <h2>
                    Fun Fact
                </h2>

                The Peregreen Falcon is the most fast bird in the world. With her wings tucked in she dives into the
                speed of 390 (maximum) km per hour
