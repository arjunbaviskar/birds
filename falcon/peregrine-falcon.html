                Speed
            </h2>
            <p>
                With the whopping speed of <b>200 miles per hour when diving</b> it is the fastest animal living on the
                planet. Then you might have a question that, how do their lungs sustain the pressure and speed? They
                could sustain the pressure and speed because of the little bone inside their nostril,
                <img src="pics/peregrine-falcon-nose.jpg" alt="Peregrine Falcon nostril" width="100xp"> it breaks up the
                flow of the air so that the air doesn't rush into their lungs. They also have a realy thick heavy boned
                keel or breastbone that provides a little sturdier skeleton for those high dives

            <h2>
                Habitat
            </h2>
            <p>
                Peregrine falcons are among the world's most common birds of prey and live on all continents except
                Antarctica.
                They prefer wide-open spaces, and thrive near coasts where shorebirds are common, but they can
                be found everywhere from tundra to deserts.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            <p>
                Peregrine falcons are solitary, territorial, top predators. Those that migrate live alone more than 8
                months of the year, spending only 16-18 weeks with a mate raising a family. Non-migratory peregrines,
                such as those in Pittsburgh, stay on territory alone or as a mated pair.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                Their typical prey items include shorebirds, ducks, grebes, gulls, pigeons, and songbirds. Peregrine
                falcons also eat bats, and they occasionally steal prey—including fish and rodents—from other raptors.
