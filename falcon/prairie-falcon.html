                </h2>
                Open hills, plains, prairies, deserts. Typically found in fairly dry open country, including grassland
                and desert. Also in open country above treeline in high mountains. In winter, often found in farmland
                and around lakes and reservoirs, and may regularly winter in some western cities.

                    Behaviour
                </h2>
                Prairie Falcon pairs are notoriously aggressive in defending their nest sites—against Great Horned Owls,
                eagles, hawks, and even other Prairie Falcons, sometimes killing fledglings that stray into the wrong
                territory.
