                </h2>

                Gyrfalcons, like other falcons, eat mainly other birds. They prefer to hunt ground birds such as
                ptarmigan and grouse but also hunt seabirds and waterfowl, as well as land mammals such as ground
                squirrels, lemmings, voles, hares, rabbits, and marmots. Gyrfalcons often hunt using a fast, low flight
                to chase their prey.

                <h2>
                    Fun Fact
                </h2>
                The gyrfalcon is the world's fastest bird in level flight.These powerful birds may initially be
                underestimated, but their strength becomes evident after a few seconds in the air.
