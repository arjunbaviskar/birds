                    Habitat
                </h2>
                The lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus) is a medium-sized bird of prey that breeds in Africa, southeast
                Europe and just into Asia. It prefers open habitat and is mainly resident, but some birds disperse more
                widely after the breeding season.

                    Behaviour
                </h2>

                Lanner falcons are diurnal meaning that they are active during the daylight hours. They live in pairs
                and often hunt in groups. Lanner falcons are fast and agile flyers and usually hunt by horizontal
                pursuit; they take mainly bird prey in flight.

                    Diet
                </h2>

                Like most other falcons, the Lanner Falcon feeds mostly on birds – small and large – including larks,
                ducks, sandgrouse, poultry, doves, and even other small raptors.
