                The Black Falcon is found along tree-lined watercourses and in isolated woodlands, mainly in arid and
                semi-arid areas. It roosts in trees at night and often on power poles by day.

                    Diet
                </h2>

                Common prey items are birds, small mammals, insects and reptiles and sometimes carrion (dead animals).
                Black Falcons also steal prey from other raptors.

                    Fun Fact
                </h2>
                The Black Falcon is a raptor (bird of prey) and is the largest of the Australian falcons. It is slim and
                uniformly dark brown to sooty black, with a pale throat. The bill and feet are blueish-white. The
                feathered legs are short and, when perched, this falcon has squared shoulders.
