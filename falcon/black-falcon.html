            <h2>
                Habitat
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Black Falcon is found along tree-lined watercourses and in isolated woodlands, mainly in arid and
                semi-arid areas. It roosts in trees at night and often on power poles by day.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            <p>
                Behaviour and ecology. The black falcon is known to both harass and be harassed
                 by other bird species, including raptors and corvids. It may be found resting 
                 on power poles during the day but will not sit on wires.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                Common prey items are birds, small mammals, insects and reptiles and sometimes carrion (dead animals).
                Black Falcons also steal prey from other raptors.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Fun Fact
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Black Falcon is a raptor (bird of prey) and is the largest of the Australian falcons. It is slim and
                uniformly dark brown to sooty black, with a pale throat. The bill and feet are blueish-white. The
                feathered legs are short and, when perched, this falcon has squared shoulders.
