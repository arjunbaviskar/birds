  <h2>
    Calling
  </h2>
  The Harpy Eagle is not particularly vocal, 
  especially away from the nest. Most calls are given at or
   near the nest, where adults give a penetrating, weak, melancholy 
   scream, usually in a series of 7-10 notes.Retting described the calls of an
    incubating male as a wailing.

<h2>
  Diet
</h2>
A hunting carnivore and an apex predator,
 the harpy eagle preys primarily on tree-dwelling mammals
  like sloths, monkeys, and opossums. They will occasionally prey 
  on other birds like macaws, and on reptiles like iguanas.

<h2>
  Eggs
</h2>
Harpy Eagles are monogamous and may mate for life.
As parents, they fiercely defend their eggs and young.
The mother lays one or two eggs in a clutch, and she only reproduces
 every two to three years.

  <h2>
    Habitat
  </h2> 
  Rare throughout its range, the harpy eagle is 
   found from Mexico (almost extinct), through Central America
    and into South America to as far south
     as Argentina. In rainforests, they live in the emergent layer.
      The eagle is most common in Brazil, where it is found across the entire
       national territory.
