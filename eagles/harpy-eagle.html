  <h2>
    Voice
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Harpy Eagle is not particularly vocal,
    especially away from the nest. Most calls are given at or
    near the nest, where adults give a penetrating, weak, melancholy
    scream, usually in a series of 7-10 notes.Retting described the calls of an
    incubating male as a wailing.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Diet
  </h2>
  <p>
    A hunting carnivore and an apex predator,
    the harpy eagle preys primarily on tree-dwelling mammals
    like sloths, monkeys, and opossums. They will occasionally prey
    on other birds like macaws, and on reptiles like iguanas.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Behaviour
  </h2>
  <p>
    Harpy Eagles are monogamous and may mate for life.
    As parents, they fiercely defend their eggs and young.
    The mother lays one or two eggs in a clutch, and she only reproduces
    every two to three years.
  <h2>
    Habitat
  </h2>
  <p>
    Rare throughout its range, the harpy eagle is
    found from Mexico (almost extinct), through Central America
    and into South America to as far south
    as Argentina. In rainforests, they live in the emergent layer.
    The eagle is most common in Brazil, where it is found across the entire
    national territory.
