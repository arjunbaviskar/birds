        Philippine eagles are generally solitary and spend time singly on in breeding pairs. They are active during the
        day and at night they rest. Philippine eagles primarily use two hunting techniques. One is still-hunting, in
        which they watch for prey activity while sitting almost motionlessly on a branch near the <a

        Philippine Eagles do eat monkeys, but they also prey on a whole host of animals, both large and small. They have
        been known to hunt bats, civets, flying squirrels, and macaques. They also eat birds, including other birds of
        prey, snakes and lizards.
