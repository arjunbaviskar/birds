                Description
            </h2>
            <p>
                Spanish Imperial Eagles are entirely brown, except for a cream-colored head and neck, white patches on
                the shoulders, and a gray uppertail. Juveniles are rufous to pale brown with dark flight feathers and
                white edges.
            </p>

            <h2> Lifespan</h2>
            <p>
                They can live to be 31 years old, with an average lifespan of 16.4.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Voice
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Spanish Imperial Eagle utters series of bark-like calls “krao-krao”. This eagle calls mainly during
                the breeding season, and to defend its hunting area against other birds of prey. It is rather silent
                outside of breeding period.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Habitat and Distribution
            </h2>
            <p>
                Spanish Imperial Eagles live in central and southwestern Spain. <a
                    href="/word-meanings/vagrant.html">vagrant</a> have been recorded in the
                Netherlands, France, Morocco, and Senegal. They used to be breed in Portugal, Algeria, and Morocco, but
                their range has decreased to include only Spain.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Spanish Imperial Eagle is often seen perched in treetops or electric pylons or towers during the
                day. It hunts in open areas, flying and soaring relatively low from the ground. When a prey is detected,
                it dives and captures it with its strong talons.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Spanish Imperial Eagle feeds mainly on rabbits and hares, but it also captures birds such as Greylag
                Goose, coots, ducks, pigeons and magpies. It catches them often on the ground diving from a perch, or
                sometimes by soaring, taking the bird perched in open, at the tip of a branch.
