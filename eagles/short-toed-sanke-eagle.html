                Habitat
            </h2>
            <p>
                The short-toed snake eagle is found in open cultivated plains, arid stony deciduous scrub areas and
                foothills and semi-desert areas. It requires trees for nesting. It requires open habitats for foraging
                such as cultivations and grasslands.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            <p>
                Breeding

                The nests of Short-Toed Eagles are built in trees approximately 6 - 7 m (19.7 - 23 ft) above the ground.
                They nest in the same area year after year, but not necessarily in the same nest site.

                Short -Toed Eagles lay only one egg between April and June. The female will <a href="incubate.html">
                    incubate </a> it for 45 - 47 days
                and when the chicks hatch they weigh approximately 90 g (3.2 oz). At 25 days old they will begin to get
                feathers and by the time they reach 45 days old, they are fully feathered and are practicing flapping
                their wings.

                The chicks fledge when they are 70 - 75 days old but they will remain around the nesting area for 6
                months. Short-Toed Eagles reach breeding age at approximately 5 years old.

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                Its prey is mostly reptiles, mainly snakes, but also some lizards. Sometimes they become entangled with
                larger snakes and battle on the ground. Occasionally, they prey on small mammals up to the size of a
                rabbit, and rarely birds and large insects. This eagle is generally very silent.
