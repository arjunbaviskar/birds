            <h2>
                Habitat
            </h2>
            <p>
                The short-toed snake eagle is found in open cultivated plains, arid stony deciduous scrub areas and
                foothills and semi-desert areas. It requires trees for nesting. It requires open habitats for foraging
                such as cultivations and grasslands.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Short-toed Snake-Eagle hunts mainly in open areas, foraging by gliding and soaring at medium height,
                but sometimes relatively high, usually between 20 and 150 metres and even more. When hunting, it hovers
                on the wind or performs wing-beats.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                Its prey is mostly reptiles, mainly snakes, but also some lizards. Sometimes they become entangled with
                larger snakes and battle on the ground. Occasionally, they prey on small mammals up to the size of a
                rabbit, and rarely birds and large insects. This eagle is generally very silent.
