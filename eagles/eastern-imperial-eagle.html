            <h2>
                Habitat
            </h2>
            <p>
                It favours open country where deciduous woods alternate with flat spreading expanses. It nests in the
                Iberian Peninsula, southeastern Europe and as far as northwestern India and Mongolia.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            <p>
                When perched, the Eastern Imperial Eagle seems to be lazy or indolent. It spends most of the day perched, as
                asleep,
                on a branch in tree or on high pole.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                Eastern Imperial Eagle hunts rabbits and hares, but also fairly large birds, snakes and lizards. It also
                consumes
                carrion and recently dead domestic animals.
