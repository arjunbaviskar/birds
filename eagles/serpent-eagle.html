    This medium-large, dark brown eagle is stocky, with rounded wings and a short tail. Its short black and white
    fan-shaped nuchal crest gives it a thick-necked appearance. The bare facial skin and feet are yellow. The underside
    is spotted with white and yellowish-brown. When perched the wing tips do not reach until the tail tip. In soaring
    flight, the broad and paddle-shaped wings are held in a shallow. The tail and underside of the flight feathers are
    black with broad white bars. Young birds show a lot of white on the head.The tarsus is unfeathered and
    covered by hexagonal scales. The upper mandible does not have an overhanging festoon to the tip.
