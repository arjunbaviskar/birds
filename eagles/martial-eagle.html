            <h2>
                Habitat
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Martial Eagle is to be found in the savannah and thornbush areas of Africa south of the Sahara, from
                Senegal to Somalia and south to the Cape. It is also found in open plains and semi-desert country, but
                not frequenting forest, although it occasionally breeds in forests on the edge of open country.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            <p>
                Martial Eagle may hunt as well in flight as from a perch. It does most of its hunting from the soar. It
                kills or attacks, making a long slanting stoop at great speed, or making a gentle descent into an
                opening in the bush.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                Birds as large as a European Stork are recorded to have fallen prey to the Martial Eagle. In other areas
                the diet is largely mammalian, especially hyrax and small antelopes. Animals as large as an Impala calf
                are taken, and some monkeys, also occasionally young domestic goats, and lambs.
