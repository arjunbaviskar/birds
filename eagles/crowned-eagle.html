            <h2>
                Description
            </h2>
            <p>
                Adult crowned eagles have a dark brown head with long crest feathers tipped in white, a cream or reddish
                breast with black bars, and wings that are black on the top and reddish underneath. Like many raptors,
                the female is larger than the male. Calling loud. Crowned eagles are known for their cry.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Speed
            </h2>
            <p>
                Crowned eagles have both a long tail and rounded wings. This helps them descend at 160 kph and allows
                them to weave through the rainforest canopy at high speed. Their legs are broader and stronger than all
                other eagles. And they have long hind talons capable of crushing heads and spines.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Voice
            </h2>
            <p>
                They are highly vocal and have a noisy, undulating display flight. The voice is a series of loud
                whistles that rise and fall in pitch.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Habitat
            </h2>
            <p>
                Crowned eagles live in forests, mountains, and grasslands in southeastern and Central Africa.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Habits and Lifestyle
            </h2>
            <p>
                Crowned eagles live in pairs. They are largely sedentary and usually inhabit a fixed territory
                throughout the year. Crowned eagles are considered nervous, constantly alert and on edge. However, their
                main hunting techniques require long periods of inactivity, spent sitting on a perch.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            <p>
                As the most powerful eagle in Africa, the crowned eagle is able to kill animals weighing up to 44 pounds
                (20 kilograms). ... Crowned eagles also eat small antelope, mongooses, feral cats, rats, monitor
                lizards, and snakes.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Fun Facts
            </h2>
            <p>
                Crowned eagles are very large; overall, they are the 9th heaviest living eagle species. These massive
                hunters are also ferocious; some records from beneath a nest show the remains of a large, male Sooty
                mangabey weighing 11 kg (24 lb). Crowned eagles are known for their spectacular displays.
