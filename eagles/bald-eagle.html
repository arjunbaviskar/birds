                Voice
            </h2>
            Calls. For such a powerful bird, the Bald Eagle emits surprisingly weak-sounding calls—usually a series
            of high-pitched whistling or piping notes. The female may repeat a single, soft, high-pitched note that
            has been called “unlike any other calls in nature”; apparently this signals her readiness for
            copulation.

            <h2>
                Diet
            </h2>
            The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey.
            Throughout their range, fish often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies
            across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and
            other prey 2%.

            <h2>
                Habitat
            </h2>
            They live near water and favor coasts and lakes where fish are plentiful, though they will also snare
            and eat small mammals. Bald eagles are believed to mate for life. A pair constructs an enormous stick
            nest—one of the bird-world's biggest—high above the ground and tends to a pair of eggs each year.

            <h2>
                Behaviour
            </h2>
            Bald eagles make a high-pitched squeaking sound. Other interesting behaviors include “talon clasping” or
            “cartwheel display”, where two eagles clasp each other's talons in mid air and spin down, letting go
            only when they've almost reached the ground. This is may be a courtship ritual as well as a territorial
            battle.
