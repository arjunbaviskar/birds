  <h2>
    Diet
  </h2>

  Many studies have reflected that the primary foods of white-tailed eagles are fish and water birds. These are the
  primary food as well for other sea eagle species. However, unlike most Haliaeetus, including the <a
    href="bald-eagle.html">Bald Eagles</a> and
  <a href="stellers-sea-eagle.html">Steller's sea Eagles</a>, the water birds tend to take the primary position in the
  diet.

  <h3>Habits and Lifestyle</h3>
  White-tailed eagles are diurnal and spend much of their day perched on trees or crags, and may often not move for
  hours. Pairs regularly <a href="word-meanings/roost.html">roost</a> together, often near to their nest, either on a crag or tree or crevices, overhung ledges
  or small isolated trees on a crag.

  <h2>
    Habitat
  </h2>

  White-tailed eagles are found along rocky coastlines, estuaries and lochs near the sea, although they will also range
  inland, especially juveniles. The species is very widely distributed, with strongholds in Russia and Norway.
