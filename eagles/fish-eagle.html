        <h2>
          Habitat
        </h2>

        fish eagles live in lowland forest up to 1,500 m above sea-level. Their nests are close to bodies of water such
        as slow-moving rivers and streams, lakes, lagoons, reservoirs, marshes, swamps and coastal lagoons and
        estuaries.

        <h2>
          Behaviour and Diet
        </h2>

        The Fish eagle feeds mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon from a perch in a tree, snatching the prey from
        the water with its large, clawed talons. The eagle then flies back to its perch to eat its catch.

        <h2>
          Fun Fact
        </h2>

        Like most raptors, African fish eagles use their feet to grab prey. These birds have very rough soles and long
        talons, enabling them to grab animals from the water. Anything taken from the water is slippy, which is why the
        eagles need such rough and long feet. Then they use a hook-shaped beak to open up their prey.
